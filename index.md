#### Background

In light of recent discussions surrounding CHI 2024, there has been careful consideration of our involvement this year. This has been driven in part by the conversation started by Josiah Hester, a Kānaka Maoli (Native Hawaiian) professor of Interactive Computing and Computer Science at Georgia Tech, who has criticized the conference's disregard for the rights and sovereignty of Native Hawaiians and locals in the wake of the Maui fires, and urged researchers to limit their involvement in the event (see[ https://www.chiinhawaii.info/](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.chiinhawaii.info/__;!!Mih3wA!FHZ5xqzETIwS_nD0StkRMMZ-Cq_m4z3p5_QlqfRlPHxFwhAfCO_vvdoQyJ9GFw6RT3myaB8oskJTqxQnhX0trCM$)). 

Some of our students have likewise expressed concerns about submitting to and/or attending the conference in person—wishing to show solidarity to Kānaka Maoli requests to halt over-tourism and academic travel to Hawai’i. However, they are also mindful of the professional implications, including missed opportunities for in-person networking, limited practice presenting to academic audiences, and reduced visibility of their research.

In response to these concerns, a mini-conference is being organized in May 2024. The event will be hosted physically at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA and virtually for remote participation. The primary goal is to spotlight the work of graduate students, pre-tenure faculty, and precariously employed academics from our region, especially research that will be presented virtually at CHI or has been withheld. Anticipate slightly extended paper presentations, each with a dedicated faculty discussant. Additional activities may include networking opportunities, paper workshop sessions, and unconference sessions (specifics to be determined).

This endeavor is seen as a means to not only alleviate potential hardships associated with reduced participation in CHI 2024 but also as an opportunity to experiment with more accessible and sustainable regional conferences—a concept beginning to be explored by the HCI community (e.g.,[ CSCW Northeast 2023](https://hci.princeton.edu/cscw-northeast/)). Our hope is that such regional conferences, if effective, can occur periodically in different places to promote sustainable academic practices into the future.
