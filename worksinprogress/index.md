### Works in Progress Information

Works in Progress will occur in the afternoon on **Wednesday, May 8** from 2:00-3:30pm and 4:00-5:30pm. Works in Progress sessions will be a small-group discussion format across 3 parallel tracks in a hybrid format.

See the the [draft schedule for more details and breakout group assignments](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11lqVKBmU--dPR0-1qv7mEu6_HNK9WPGvT89Kg8-7Nsg/edit?usp=sharing).

Each group will have 90 minutes to discuss 3 WIP papers. We will spend 30 minutes on each paper, with approximately 5 minutes for the authors to give a short presentation on the paper and 25 minutes for group discussion and feedback. Each group will also have a faciltiator to help moderate the conversation and provide additional feedback.

### WiP Papers
Works in Progress Papers are available in this [Google Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CEqufRqZeg5NjXAizPLphHAE5HCgHxFP?usp=drive_link).

### Instructions for All WiP Attendees:
Any meeting attendee is welcome to attend the Works in Progress session! We ask that attendees (and presenters) do the following:

* **Please bring a laptop and headphones with you to the meeting**. Most breakout groups will be hybrid, and we will ask that both virtual and in-person participants join Zoom on their own computers to participate. 
* **Before the meeting, please try to take a quick look at the short WIP papers in the sessions you plan to attend**, to help give feedback to the authors. Papers are available in this [Google Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CEqufRqZeg5NjXAizPLphHAE5HCgHxFP?usp=drive_link).

### Instructions for Presenters: 
We are asking that each author prepare a **short 5 minute oral presentation** (without slides) to briefly introduce their WIP to the group. We suggest that the presentation contain the following elements:
* Desired audience/venue
* Key argument
* Key evidence collected (or planned to be collected)
* How far along the WIP project is
* What feedback would be helpful?

We ask that WIP authors read over the other 2 WIP papers in their session ahead of time to give feedback. We will recommend that other meeting attendees also take a brief look at the papers before attending a  WIP session. 

#### Instructions for Facilitators:
Please take a look at the papers in your breakout group before the session, in order to help give feedback to authors. Faciltiators can also help moderate the conversation and keep track of time of the sessions.
