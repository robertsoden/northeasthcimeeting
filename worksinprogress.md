## Works in Progress Information

Works in Progress sessions will be a small-group discussion format across 3 parallel tracks. See the [draft schedule for more details](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11lqVKBmU--dPR0-1qv7mEu6_HNK9WPGvT89Kg8-7Nsg/edit?usp=sharing).

Each group will have 90 minutes to discuss 3 WIP papers. We will spend 30 minutes on each paper, with approximately 5 minutes for the authors to give a short presentation on the paper and 25 minutes for group discussion and feedback. 

### Instructions for Presenters and Attendees:
* **Please bring a laptop and headphones with you to the meeting**. Most breakout groups will be hybrid, and we will ask that both virtual and in-person participants join Zoom on their own computers to participate. 
* **Before the meeting, please try to take a quick look at the short WIP papers in the sessions you plan to attend**, to help give feedback to the authors. We will distribute links to these by Monday, April 29.

### Instructions for Presenters: 
We are asking that each author prepare a **short 5 minute oral presentation** (without slides) to briefly introduce their WIP to the group. We suggest that the presentation contain the following elements:
* Desired audience/venue
* Key argument
* Key evidence collected (or planned to be collected)
* How far along the WIP project is
* What feedback would be helpful?

We ask that WIP authors read over the other 2 WIP papers in their session ahead of time to give feedback. We will recommend that other meeting attendees also take a brief look at the papers before attending a  WIP session.
